# Js DrumKit

This task is from the challenge "30 projects in 30 days", in which I made `DrumKit` controlled by the keyboard. You can use it for your own purposes.

### Quickstart
You can see the working UI/UX of this task by the link: https://khanevich.github.io/DrumKit/


### Create a new project based on the DrumKit
Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., DrumKit).
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/khanevich/DrumKit DrumKit
cd DrumKit
```
